# Debugging Requests

While it is recommended that SpiceDB [schema] be validated and tested before production deployment, there are many scenarios in which being able to see the _actual_ paths taken against production data is incredibly important.

[schema]: /spicedb/concepts/schema

To support this use case the CheckPermission API supports a special debug header which can be used to retrieve the _full_ set of relations and permission traversed in order to compute the result.

<Callout type="info">
  Calling the CheckPermission API with the debug header set will result in a small, but noticable performance penalty.
  It is highly recommended to **NOT** set this header unless a trace is required.
</Callout>

## Displaying explanations via zed

The simplest way to use the tracing system is to use the [zed] CLI tool with the `--explain` flag:

[zed]: https://github.com/authzed/zed

```sh
zed permission check --explain document:firstdoc view user:fred
```

Example output:

```ansi
true
[32mâœ“[0m [37mdocument[0m:[37mfirstdoc[0m [38;5;35mview[0m (66.333Âµs)
â”œâ”€â”€ [31mâ¨‰[0m [90mdocument[0m:[90mfirstdoc[0m [90mwriter[0m (12.375Âµs)
â””â”€â”€ [32mâœ“[0m [37mdocument[0m:[37mfirstdoc[0m [38;5;166mreader[0m (20.667Âµs)
    â””â”€â”€ [38;5;99muser:fred [0m
```

### Cached results

If the result for a CheckPermission has already been cached by SpiceDB, then that will be indicated:

```ansi
true
[32mâœ“[0m [37mdocument[0m:[37mfirstdoc[0m [37mview[0m[36m (cached)[0m
â””â”€â”€ [38;5;99muser:fred [0m
```

### Cycle detection

If the schema and relationships within SpiceDB forms a cycle, it will be indicated in the output:

```
! document:foo view
â”œâ”€â”€ âœ• document:foo viewer
â””â”€â”€ ! document:bar view
    â”œâ”€â”€ âœ• document:bar viewer
    â””â”€â”€ ! document:baz view
        â”œâ”€â”€ âœ• document:baz viewer
        â””â”€â”€ ! document:foo view (cycle)
```

## Using the tracing API directly

If you wish to call `CheckPermission` and retrieve the debug traces directly, there are a few steps involved:

1. Set the [header] `io.spicedb.requestdebuginfo` to value `true` on the request
2. Retrieve the [trailer] `io.spicedb.respmeta.debuginfo` and parse the JSON found within as a [DebugInformation] message.
